# Extension Icons Required

The following icon files are required but missing:
- icon-16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon-32.png (32x32 pixels)  
- icon-48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon-128.png (128x128 pixels)

These are referenced in extension/manifest.json.

For development, you can:
1. Create placeholder images with any image editor
2. Use a single icon and resize it to all required sizes
3. Or temporarily comment out icon references in manifest.json
